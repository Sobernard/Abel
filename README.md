## Building and installation instructions

The easiest way to install the latest released version of Abel - Ruffini Theorem as a Mathematical Component
is via [OPAM](https://opam.ocaml.org/doc/Install.html):

```shell
opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
opam install coq-mathcomp-abel
```

To instead build and install manually, do:

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/math-comp/abel.git
cd abel
make   # or make -j <number-of-cores-on-your-machine> 
make install
```


## Organization of the code

- `abel.v` itself contains the main theorems:
  + `galois_solvable_by_radical` (requires explicit roots of unity),
  + `ext_solvable_by_radical` (equivalent, and still requires roots of unity),
  + `radical_solvable_ext` (no mention of roots of unity),
  + `AbelGalois`, (equivalence obtained from the above to, requires  roots of unity)
  + and their consequence `example_not_solvable_by_radicals` (with one admit)

- `xmathcomp/various.v` contains various (rather straightforward)
  extensions that should be added to various mathcomp packages asap
  with potential minor modifications,

- `xmathcomp/char0.v` contains 0 characteristic specific results,
  that could use a refactoring for a smoother integration with
  mathcomp. e.g. ratr could get a canonical structure or rmorphism
  when the target field is a `lmodType ratr`, and we could provide a
  wrapper`NullCharType` akin to `PrimeCharType` (from `finfield.v`),

- `xmathcomp/cyclotomic.v` contains complementary results about
  cyclotomic polynomials, (there is still one admit),

- `xmathcomp/map_gal.v` contains complementary results about galois
  groups and galois extensions, including various isomorphisms,
  minimal galois extensions, solvable extensions, and mapping galois
  groups and galois extensions from a splitting field to
  another. This last construction is essential in switching to
  fields with roots of unity when we do not have them yet,

- `xmathcomp/classic_ext.v` contains the theory of classic
  extensions by arbitrary polynomials, most of the results there are
  in the classically monad, making the results available either for
  a boolean goal or a classical goal. This was instrumental in
  eliminating references to some embarrassing roots of the unity.

- `xmathcomp/diag.v` contains the theory of diagonalisation and
  codiagonalisation with the standard criterions.

- `xmathcomp/mxgal.v` represents elements of a Galois group as
  matrices, this enables the use of `diag` to find eigenvectors and
  eigenvalues.

- `xmathcomp/mxextra.v` is a correspondance between `'M_(_,_)` and `'Hom(_, _)`
   which is unused in the current development, we use `mxgal` instead.
